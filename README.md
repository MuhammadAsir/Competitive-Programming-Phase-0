# Competitive Programming – Phase 0 (C++) 🏆

Welcome to my **Competitive Programming Phase 0** repository.

This repository documents my foundational journey into competitive programming using **C++**. Phase 0 focuses on mastering the basics before moving to advanced data structures and algorithms.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Phase 0

The main objectives of this phase are:

- Build strong problem-solving skills
- Strengthen C++ fundamentals
- Develop logical thinking
- Understand basic time and space complexity
- Prepare for higher-level competitive programming phases

This phase is about consistency, discipline, and building a solid base.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

This repository includes problems and practice on:

- Basic Input / Output
- Data Types
- Operators
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions
- Arrays
- Basic Mathematics
- Pattern Problems
- Introductory Time & Space Complexity

More advanced topics will be added in future phases.
